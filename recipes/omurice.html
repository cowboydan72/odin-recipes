    <!--Ingredients List-->
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 Eggs</li>
        <li>White Rice</li>
        <li>Frozen Peas</li>
        <li>Soy Sauce</li>

        <li>Meat (Your choice, we will be using shredded pork)</li>
    </ul>

    <!--Cooking Instructions-->
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook your rice according to the instructions on its packaging, day old rice works better if you have it</li>
        <li>Cook the ground beef on medium until it is safe to eat</li>
        <li>Add all other ingredients in to the pan with the meat</li>
        <li>Once it is all brought to the desired temperature place on a plate and shape roughly into a football</li>
        <li>Scramble your eggs before adding to a pan for cooking</li>
        <li>Cook at very high heat while constantly stirring the egg with chopsticks to keep it runny and pull cooked egg from the sides the middle while stirring</li>
        <li>Once the bottom starts to cook through and the top is still runny start tossing the omelette towards the front of the pan and start to make the football shape.  Use chopsticks to push the bottom or top edges over the runny egg if needed</li>
        <li>This is the hardest step, flip the whole omelette while retaining that shape to cook the top side and seal the runny egg inside</li>
        <li>Slide the omelette over your fried rice so that the seamless part is on top</li>
        <li>Slice the omelette down the middle to let the runny parts out and add any other spices you like</li>
    </ol>
